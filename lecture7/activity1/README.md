# Activities

## Task 1:

- Answer at least 5 questions from the following link. Make sure you write the question as well as the answer.
  https://opendsa-server.cs.vt.edu/OpenDSA/Exercises/Graph/GraphIntroSumm.html

> You can refer to [link #2](#links) below for more info.
1)A simple cycle:

   X must have all vertices unique except that the first and last vertices are the same
    must have all vertices be unique
    allows repetition of vertices so long as the length of the path is less than 5
    None of the above
 2)The number of edges incident to that vertex called its:

    number
    depth
    size
    count
   x degree
  3) A DAG is a directed graph without cycles.

    True
  4) A complete graph is a clique of size:

    n
   x |V|
    |n|
    None of the above
   5)Two vertices of a graph are ADJACENT if there is an edge joining them.

    True 



## Task 2

- Discuss how depth-first search works by experimenting with the following link. Try both directed and undirected graphs and write a short summary.

> You can refer to [link #3](#links) below for more info.
Whenever a vertex v is visited during the search, DFS will recursively visit all of v â€˜s unvisited neighbors. Equivalently, DFS will add all edges leading out of v to a stack. The next vertex to be visited is determined by popping the stack and following that edge. The effect is to follow one branch through the graph to its conclusion, then it will back up and follow another branch, and so on. 

## Task 3

- Discuss how breadth-first search works by experimenting with the following link. Try both directed and undirected graphs and write a short summary.
  https://opendsa-server.cs.vt.edu/OpenDSA/AV/Graph/BFSAV.html

> You can refer to [link #4](#links) below for more info.

## Task 4:

- Reproduce the behavior of the BFS algorithm for the following graph:
  https://opendsa-server.cs.vt.edu/OpenDSA/AV/Graph/BFSPE.html

BFS examines all vertices connected to the start vertex before visiting vertices further away. BFS is implemented similarly to DFS, except that a queue replaces the recursion stack. Note that if the graph is a tree and the start vertex is at the root, BFS is equivalent to visiting vertices level by level from top to bottom.

## Task 5: Individual (at home)

- There are two traditional approaches to representing graphs: The adjacency matrix and the adjacency list. What are the main differences in term of space/time complexity. You can refer to following link:
